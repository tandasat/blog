title: "Hypervisor enforced security policies for NTOS, secure kernel and a child partition"
---

This post aims to clarify security policies implemented by the Windows hypervisor for the root partition VTL 0 (NTOS), 1 (secure kernel), and a child partition (guest VM) by comparing their VMCSes on an Intel platform.

## Summary

I start with the summary of my take, as the rest of this article is fairly "dry".

The most interesting difference is VTL 1 having writable code. I heard of this but never verified it myself. I knew VTL 1 mapped UEFI runtime service code with the writable permission when the [Memory
Attributes Table](https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/04_EFI_System_Table.html#efi-memory-attributes-table) was unavailable, but my target system did have it and properly implemented W^X ([ref](https://github.com/tandasat/List-UEFI-Configuration-Tables)). I am unclear why code is left writable almost entirely. Similarly, it is questionable that IA32_EFER.NXE is not set for the VTL 1 guest.

The other intriguing part is largely accessible IO ports from VTL 0. I would have to study the functionality of these IO ports a bit more to be confident to say these are ok in this way. You may find the list of documented IO ports in volume 1 of the PCH specification, for example:

![](/blog/img/posts/2024-02-12/io-ports.png)

On MSRs, besides the undocumented MSRs, it is worth recreating the list on newer models as it might change depending on the existence of physical MSRs. Additionally, `IA32_SPEC_CTRL` being writable from the child partition is interesting. Could not a guest disable mitigation features and leak information? I would be curious to know.

On CR4, it is interesting that more bits are intercepted and shadowed for VTL 0 than the child partition. I cannot think of a reason off the top of my head.

It may be good security research to compare these with other hypervisor-protected systems. Is there a similar software architecture with a different setup, and would that imply overlooked security holes on that system or Windows? In addition to that, being intercepted by a hypervisor does not mean there is no chance of a bug; it is an attack surface to be inspected.

The rest of the post analyzes [raw data](https://gist.github.com/tandasat/3a60ee4cc5b9519cadf60393814918e9).


## Setup

I checked VMCS configurations on Windows 11 22H2 on the 9th generation Intel processor. The guest partition is Windows 11 22H2 with Hyper-V configuration version 11.0. HVCI is enabled for the root partition and disabled for the guest partition.


## Comparison


### MSRs

The lists of MSRs accessible without interception are the same between VTL 0 and 1. The child partition can access only a subset of these MSRs.

This is a list of writable MSRs for VTL 0 and 1. Ones writable from the child partition are marked with (G).

### IO ports

The lists of IO ports accessible without interception are different between 3 configurations.
- For VTL 0, all ports except below are accessible:
  - 0x20, 0x21, 0xa0, 0xa1 - Master and Slave PIC ([reference](https://wiki.osdev.org/PIC))
  - 0x64 - PS/2 Controller ([reference](https://wiki.osdev.org/%228042%22_PS/2_Controller))
  - 0xcf8, 0xcfc-0xcff - PCI config address and data ([reference](https://wiki.osdev.org/PCI))
  - 0x1805 - (upper) PM1 control registers
- For VTL 1, all ports are accessible.
- For the child partition, none of the ports are accessible.


### Memory

Below are a few observations with a quick look.

- For both VTL 0 and 1, translations are identity-mapped.
- For VTL 1, code is almost entirely writable even if HVCI is enabled for VTL 0.
- For the child partition, translations are simple offsets within a few large blocks of physical memory.
  - For example, when GPA 0x0 is mapped to PA 0x224200000, GPA 0x4600000 is mapped to 0x228800000 (0x224200000 + 0x4600000).

#### Primary processor-based VM-execution controls

There are a few differences.
- for VTL 1, "Interrupt-window exiting" is enabled
- for the child partition, MWAIT, MONITOR, and MOV-DR are intercepted
- for the child partition, all IO port access are intercepted

#### Secondary processor-based VM-execution controls

There are a few differences:
- For the child partition, "WBINVD" is intercepted.
- "Mode-based execute control for EPT" is enabled only for VTL 0. This is because VTL 1 does not have as strict memory protection as VTL 0, and the child partition (VM) was not configured to enable HVCI.

## Call for actions

Besides the open questions I made above, there are opportunities to find new vulnerabilities in the Windows hypervisor if you extend [hvext.js](https://github.com/tandasat/hvext) for AMD platforms. I discovered [two](https://github.com/tandasat/CVE-2023-36427) [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/tandasat/CVE-2024-21305) specific to the Intel platforms while writing the tool, so I would not be surprised if similar issues exist on AMD platforms.


## Reference: steps to get them

1. [Enable hypervisor debugging](https://tandasat.github.io/blog/windows/2023/03/21/setting-up-kdnet-over-usb-eem-for-bootloader-and-hyper-v-debugging.html) and get hvext.js working.

2. Reduce the number of logical processors to 1 and reboot. This makes VTL 0, 1 and guest transitions tremendously clearer.

    ```
    > bcdedit /set numproc 1
    ```

3. To break on VMCS switching, we need to set breakpoints on the all `VMPTRLD` instructions in the hypervisor image. For this, get the range of hypervisor's .text section first.

    ```
    kd> lm
    start             end                 module name
    fffff863`87673000 fffff863`87a75000   hv         (no symbols)

    kd> !dh -s fffff863`87673000
    ...
    SECTION HEADER #9
      .text name
      19C0C4 virtual size
      200000 virtual address
      19D000 size of raw data
    ...
    ```

4. Then, search the `VMPTRLD` instructions in the range with the `#` command.

    ```
    kd> # vmptrld fffff863`87673000+200000 L 19C0C4
    ...
    ```

5. Finally, set a breakpoint for each discovered instruction.

    Note that there were 41 instances of the `VMPTRLD` instructions in the version I tested, and Windbg could set only up to 30 breakpoints. However, this was not a big issue as only 4 of them were used during the regular operation. To figure out which instructions are used, you can trace execution of them instead of breaking in each time with commands like this:
